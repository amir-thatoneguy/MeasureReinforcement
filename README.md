Measure Reinforcement (MR): A Relational Quantum Framework for Emergent Causality
Core Contribution:
We introduce Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI), a novel causal measure defined by:

Quantum Transfer Entropy (T_{y→x|z}) → Directional information flow.

Entanglement Gradient (∇S(ρ_x)) → Temporal asymmetry driver.

Petz Recovery Bounds → Fundamental limits of causal resolution.

Exponential Bias Term (e^{−βS(ρ_x‖ρ_y)}) → Accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction.

Key Innovations:

STDP from Quantum Foundations:
MRI updates (μ_t = γμ_{t−1} + ϕ(T)) replicate spike-timing-dependent plasticity without ad hoc learning rates, deriving Hebbian rules from entanglement thermodynamics.

Time from Entanglement:
Sequential causality emerges from parallel quantum processing via decoherence-driven measure reinforcement.

Gravity Analogue:
The bias term’s "pull" toward high-entanglement states suggests a holographic principle: causal influence warps like spacetime near mass.

Born Rule Recovery:
MRI converges to probability gradients (μ_∞ ∝ Tr[ρ_x^2]) under Petz conditions, bridging RQM and QBism.

Rigor & Validation:

Theorems: Convergence to true causal graphs in finite dimensions.

Numerics: 3-qubit simulations showing MRI outperforms classical causal discovery in entangled regimes.

Interpretation: MR as applied phenomenology, where observers optimize causal metrics via quantum Darwinism.

Implications:

Quantum Biology: STDP as a shadow of entanglement gradients.

Quantum AI: MRI-driven causal circuits (NISQ-compatible via Kitaev-style approximation).

Fundamental Physics: Causal asymmetry → spacetime emergence.


This is part of an ongoing project at the intersection of quantum foundations, cognition, and emergent geometry. More to come.
