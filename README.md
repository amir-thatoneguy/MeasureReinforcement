Measure Reinforcement (MR): A Relational Quantum Framework for Emergent Causality


Core Contribution:
We introduce Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI), a novel causal measure defined by:

Quantum Transfer Entropy (T_{y→x|z}) → Directional information flow.

Entanglement Gradient (∇S(ρ_x)) → Temporal asymmetry driver.

Petz Recovery Bounds → Fundamental limits of causal resolution.

Exponential Bias Term (e^{−βS(ρ_x‖ρ_y)}) → Accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction.


This work introduces Measure Reinforcement (MR), a relational quantum framework for emergent causality, defining a new measure, the Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI), which combines transfer entropy, entanglement growth, recovery bounds, and an exponential bias term that accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction.



The asymmetry of MR updates mirrors spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in neural systems. In this analogy, entanglement gradients act as temporal difference signals, reinforcing directionality of influence. Our exponential update rule leads to Hebbian-like dynamics without explicitly defined learning rates—emerging naturally from entropic information flow. Thus, MR recovers biological learning principles from quantum foundations.


As applied phenomenology, MR optimizes a causal influence metric, showing how parallel quantum processing yields sequential processing, leading to emergent perception of time. Asymmetric information flow connects to spacetime and gravity, interpreting mass as causal influence, and the framework recovers the Born rule in the limit, aligning entropy and probability gradients. The work includes theoretical convergence proofs, Petz recovery analysis, and numerical simulations.

This is part of an ongoing project at the intersection of quantum foundations, cognition, and emergent geometry. More to come.
