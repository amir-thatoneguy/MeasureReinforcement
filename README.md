Measure Reinforcement (MR): A Relational Quantum Framework for Emergent Causality
Core Contribution:
We introduce Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI), a novel causal measure defined by:

Quantum Transfer Entropy (T_{y→x|z}) → Directional information flow.

Entanglement Gradient (∇S(ρ_x)) → Temporal asymmetry driver.

Petz Recovery Bounds → Fundamental limits of causal resolution.

Exponential Bias Term (e^{−βS(ρ_x‖ρ_y)}) → Accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction.


This is part of an ongoing project at the intersection of quantum foundations, cognition, and emergent geometry. More to come.
