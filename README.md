This work introduces Measure Reinforcement (MR), a relational quantum framework for emergent causality, defining a new measure, the Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI), which combines transfer entropy, entanglement growth, recovery bounds, and an exponential bias term that accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction. MR bridges quantum cognition and neural learning through entanglement-driven updates that mirror spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). As applied phenomenology, MR optimizes a causal influence metric, showing how parallel quantum processing yields sequential processing, leading to emergent time. Asymmetric information flow connects to spacetime and gravity, interpreting mass as causal influence, and the framework recovers the Born rule in the limit, aligning entropy and probability gradients. The work includes theoretical convergence proofs, Petz recovery analysis, and numerical simulations.
