Measure Reinforcement (MR): A Relational Quantum Framework for Emergent Causality


This work introduces Measure Reinforcement (MR), a relational quantum framework for emergent causality, defining a new measure—Measure Reinforcement Influence (MRI)—which combines transfer entropy, entanglement gradients, recovery bounds, and an exponential bias that accelerates convergence and mirrors gravitational attraction.

The asymmetry of MR updates mirrors spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in neural systems. In this analogy, entanglement gradients act as temporal difference signals, reinforcing directionality of influence. The exponential update rule leads to Hebbian-like learning dynamics without explicitly defined learning rates—emerging naturally from quantum informational flow.

As applied phenomenology, MR optimizes a causal influence metric over entanglement-based interactions. It shows how parallel quantum processing yields emergent sequential structure, giving rise to the perception of time. Asymmetric information flow maps directly onto spacetime and gravity, with mass interpreted as accumulated causal influence.

The MR framework recovers the Born rule in the limit, aligning entropy and probability gradients. It includes theoretical convergence proofs, Petz recovery analysis, and numerical simulations. MR offers a unified approach to quantum cognition, neural learning, causal emergence, and the quantum measurement problem.

This is part of an ongoing project at the intersection of quantum foundations, cognition, and emergent geometry. More to come.
